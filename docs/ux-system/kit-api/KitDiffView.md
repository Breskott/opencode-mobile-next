# KitDiffView — API freeze (wave 0)

Unit: `kit-KitDiffView` (wave 1, tier 1d, kind `kit-part`). Write set (work-units.json): `lib/ui/kit/kit_diff_view.dart` (new), `lib/ui/widgets/diff_view.dart` (becomes a wrapper, C24; slice-P3.7a deletes it, C45), `test/kit/kit_diff_view_test.dart`, `test/goldens/kit/kit_diff_view_golden_test.dart`; its `tests` list: `test/diff_view_test.dart`, `test/reader_preferences_test.dart`, `test/demo_isolation_test.dart`. Spec: kit-v2.md §1.15, §8.2 ("diffs side by side from expanded"), map proposals for review-workspace (Fix: one KitDiffView with a sticky file header, one "Change 1 of N" navigator across files, hanging indents, `@@` as line ranges) and diff-view (a read-only mode of the one component); C15, C24, C25, C33, C36, C45. Rules: STATE-9, STATE-11, KIT-32, LAY-8, LOOK-6, COPY-30, A11Y-2, PERF-2, MOT-5, TEST-5, KIT-43, R11, R12.

## Purpose

The one diff renderer: unified on a phone, side by side from an expanded window, with one file header, one "Change 1 of N" navigator across files, a file list, and line selection for Comment, Add to prompt and Copy. It serves the review workspace, revert previews, run results and a request's "See the change".

## Replaces

- **Map elements (kit-v2.json `assignment` → `KitDiffView`): 6 elements on 2 pages.**
  - diff-view (diff-view-body: the second renderer, whose continuation lines lose their indentation);
  - review-workspace (review-workspace-diff: `_UnifiedDiffRow`/`_SplitDiffRow`; review-workspace-file-header: the file name shown three times; review-workspace-file-strip: chips repeating each name and `+/-`; review-workspace-hunk-nav: "1 ↑↓" plus a bottom "1 hunk" bar; review-workspace-selection-bar: clear, copy, add, Comment).
- **Merged proposal names:** `KitDiffView`.
- **Moved by this unit (C24, R12):** `lib/ui/widgets/diff_view.dart` (811 lines; G16 `AppBar` 1, `CloseButton` 1, `Container` 2, `Icon` 2, `IconButton` 1, `InkWell` 1, `Material` 2, `Scaffold` 1, `SingleChildScrollView` 1, `SliverPersistentHeader` 1, `SnackBar` 2, `Text` 13, `Tooltip` 1; G1 `SnackBar(` 2, `showSnackBar(` 2). Its parser (`_DiffModel`: unified patch and before/after pair, 3 context lines, 20-line expansion) moves into the kit as `KitDiffFile.fromPatch`/`fromTexts`. `DiffView`, `DiffView.single`, `DiffView.open`, `DiffRow`, `DiffRowKind` and `DiffGap` keep compiling as forwarding wrappers (KIT-43: `/// Retired by kit-KitDiffView: use KitDiffView`, and G2 ratchet patterns `DiffView(` and `DiffView.single(`). The wrapper's copy uses `KitIconButton.copy`, so its 2 `SnackBar`s go (G1 and G16 for the file drop).
- **Callers of the wrapper (unchanged by this unit):** `chat_screen.dart` (`DiffView(`, chat chain), `chat/permission_sheet.dart` and `staged_revert_screen.dart` (`DiffView.single(`).
- **Code reach, adopted by other units:**
  - `review_workspace.dart`'s own renderer: `_ReviewFileStrip`, `_ReviewFileList`, `_ReviewDiffToolbar`, `_ReviewPhoneDiffToolbar`, `_ReviewDiffCanvas`, `_UnifiedDiffRow`, `_SplitDiffRow`, `_ReviewSelectionBar`, `_ReviewHunkBar` (G16 in that file: `Container` 18, `Icon` 20, `IconButton` 12, `InkWell` 8, `TextButton` 9, `Scrollbar` 3, `RotatedBox` 2, `VerticalDivider` 2, `IntrinsicHeight` 2; G15 width literals 2) → screen-review-1 (C37);
  - `run_result_view.dart`, `merge_section.dart` and the request's "See the change" → shared-review-1, slice-P3.7a (C36, C45), kit-KitRequestSheet (C15).
- **Widgets retired directly:** in `diff_view.dart`, the renderer's `Container`, `InkWell`, `Material`, `SliverPersistentHeader`, `SingleChildScrollView`, `Tooltip`, `IconButton` and most `Text` counts, and both `SnackBar`s (copy becomes `KitIconButton.copy`). The wrapper keeps its route frame (`Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `CloseButton`, the title `Text`) until slice-P3.7a deletes the file, so no counts rise.

## File

- `lib/ui/kit/kit_diff_view.dart`: `KitDiffLineKind`, `KitDiffLine`, `KitDiffGap`, `KitDiffFileStatus`, `KitDiffFile`, `KitDiffMode`, `KitDiffSide`, `KitDiffSelection`, `KitDiffView`, `showKitDiff`.
- `lib/ui/widgets/diff_view.dart`: forwarding wrapper. It converts `FileDiff` (`lib/api/models.dart`, which it already imports; the kit never imports `lib/api`, ARCH-1) to `KitDiffFile`, reads the reader wrap preference and passes it in, and keeps the `diff-view` key on its frame.
- Tests: `test/kit/kit_diff_view_test.dart`; `test/diff_view_test.dart` keeps passing against the wrapper.
- Gallery: `test/goldens/kit/kit_diff_view_golden_test.dart`.

- **Layout.**
  - **File header** (sticky at the top of the diff): "3 files · README.md +4 −1". With 2+ files it is a `KitPickerRow` that opens `showKitChoiceSheet` of the files (each: path, `+n −n`, the status word). With one file it is a plain header. It carries the file's `fileActions` in a `KitIconButton` "More" (Copy file, Copy patch, Ask about this file, …), and Wrap.
  - **File list** (from a large diff box, `KitLayout.windowFor(width) == large`, with 2+ files): a column of `paneListWidth` (296, LAY-5) at the start, one row per file with its counts and status, the current one selected. The picker row is then just the header.
  - **Navigator:** "Change 1 of 7" with previous and next `KitIconButton`s (48 dp), across files: next on the last change of a file opens the next file's first change.
  - **Lines:** a line-number gutter (both numbers in unified, one per side in split), a `+`/`−` glyph column, then the text. Continuation lines of a wrapped line are indented to the text column (a hanging indent). Hunk headers read as line ranges ("Lines 12–18").
  - **Gaps:** "Show 20 unchanged lines" bars that expand in place by `expandStep` and collapse again; a gap without lines states its count only.
  - **Selection** (`readOnly: false`): tap or drag on line numbers selects a range on one side; the selection bar is a `KitActionBlock` pinned at the bottom: Comment (primary), Add to prompt and Copy lines (tertiary), and Clear (a `KitIconButton`).
- **Compatibility (R11).** The wrapper keeps `DiffView({diffs, title, allowCopy})`, `DiffView.single`, `DiffView.open`, `DiffView.wrapBelow`, `DiffView.expandStep`, and the public `DiffRow`, `DiffRowKind`, `DiffGap` types. It passes `keyPrefix: 'diff'`, so `diff-file-header-<path>`, `diff-gap-<i>`, `diff-expand-down-<i>`, `diff-collapse-<i>` and `diff-view-horizontal` keep their meaning (TEST-5; used by `test/diff_view_test.dart`).
- **Internal keys (`<prefix>` = `keyPrefix`):** `<prefix>-file-header-<path>`, `<prefix>-file-picker`, `<prefix>-file-list`, `<prefix>-file-row-<index>`, `<prefix>-nav-previous`, `<prefix>-nav-next`, `<prefix>-nav-label`, `<prefix>-gap-<i>`, `<prefix>-expand-down-<i>`, `<prefix>-collapse-<i>`, `<prefix>-horizontal`, `<prefix>-line-<file>-<side>-<n>`, `<prefix>-selection-bar`, `<prefix>-open-all`.
- **Kit copy (ARB, `kit` prefix, en + ar):** `kitDiffFiles` "{count, plural, =1{1 file} other{{count} files}}", `kitDiffChangeOf` "Change {index} of {count}", `kitDiffPreviousChange` "Previous change", `kitDiffNextChange` "Next change", `kitDiffLines` "Lines {start}–{end}", `kitDiffShowUnchanged` "{count, plural, =1{Show 1 unchanged line} other{Show {count} unchanged lines}}", `kitDiffHideUnchanged` "Hide unchanged lines", `kitDiffUnchangedCount` "{count, plural, other{{count} unchanged lines}}", `kitDiffNoChanges` "No changes", `kitDiffBinary` "Binary file · not shown", `kitDiffRenamed` "Renamed from {path}", `kitDiffAddedFile` "New file", `kitDiffDeletedFile` "Deleted", `kitDiffTooBig` "Showing {shown} of {total} lines", `kitDiffOpenAll` "Open all", `kitDiffLineAdded` "Line {number} added", `kitDiffLineRemoved` "Line {number} removed", `kitDiffComment` "Comment", `kitDiffAddToPrompt` "Add to prompt", `kitDiffCopyLines` "Copy lines", `kitDiffClearSelection` "Clear selection", `kitDiffSelected` "{count, plural, =1{1 line selected} other{{count} lines selected}}", `kitDiffCounts` "{added} added, {removed} removed", `kitDiffLoadFailed` "Couldn't load the changes", plus the shared `kitWrapLines`, `kitMore` "More" (KitAction.md), `kitTryAgain`.

## States

| State | Look |
|---|---|
| loading | skeleton diff lines (`KitSkeletonRows`), the header already sized |
| empty (`files` empty) | inline `KitStateView` "No changes" |
| error | inline `KitStateView` with `error` as its body and Try again (`onRetry`) |
| loaded | header, navigator, lines |
| file binary | the file's header, then "Binary file · not shown" (and the counts, if known) |
| file renamed / added / deleted | the status word on the header's supporting line ("Renamed from lib/old.dart") |
| too big (`maxLines`) | the first `maxLines` lines, then "Showing 400 of 3,200 lines" with "Open all" (`onOpenAll`) |
| selecting | selected lines tinted, the selection bar with "3 lines selected" |

KIT-12 doc comment: "States: loading, empty, error, loaded, binary, renamed, too-big, selecting". Disabled: Comment is disabled with a reason when the selection spans both sides ("Select lines on one side").

## Tokens

- **ThemeRoles:** `codeAddedSurface` / `codeRemovedSurface` (line tints), `success` (`+` glyph and `+n`), `codeRemoved` (`−` glyph and `−n`; VL §3's code role), `text1` (line text), `text3` (line numbers, context `+/−` column), `text2` (gap bars, hunk ranges), `hairline` (header rule, split divider), `accent` (the selection mark on selected line numbers and the current file row's mark, LOOK-6), `surface1` (sticky header over `ground`).
- **KitText:** `mono` (lines, numbers, paths), `rowTitle` (the header path), `secondary` (header supporting line, gap bars), `caption` (navigator label), `button` via `KitButton`.
- **KitTokens (VL branch):** `rowHeight` (header), `minTarget`, `space1`–`space4`, `smallIconSize`, `panelCornerRadius` (file list panel), `detailsSurface` (the diff surface).
- **Layout names:** `KitLayout.paneListWidth` (296 after the LAY-5 amendment), `KitLayout.windowFor` on the diff's own width.
- **Pre-wave seams:** `KitTokens.hairlineWidth` (the split divider and header rule), `KitBidi`, `KitCopy`, `KitRedact`.
- **No new tokens.** The line tint is the existing `codeAddedSurface`/`codeRemovedSurface` getters on `ThemeRoles`.

## Adaptive

| Diff box width (`KitLayout.windowFor(width)`) | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| compact | unified; lines wrap by default (today's `DiffView.wrapBelow` 600 rule); file picker row |
| medium | unified; lines scroll sideways by default (Wrap toggles); file picker row |
| expanded | split side by side (`mode: null` or `split`), each side scrolling together; file picker row |
| large | split, plus the file list column at the start |

The box width, not only the window, decides: a diff in the 340 dp changes pane of a large window renders unified (LAY-5 panes). `mode: split` in a narrow box renders unified, and the host's mode control shows the reason ("Side by side needs a wider window") through its own `disabledReason`.

- **Keyboard (LAY-10):** Tab reaches the file picker or list, the navigator, Wrap, More, then the lines. `n` / `p` (and F7 / Shift+F7) move to the next and previous change when the diff has focus; Up/Down move by line; Shift+Up/Down extend a selection; Enter on a selection runs Comment; Esc clears the selection; Ctrl+C copies it.
- **Pointer:** mouse drag over line numbers selects; text is mouse-selectable for copying; hover shows the navigator and More tooltips; right-click on a line opens a menu with Comment, Add to prompt and Copy lines (the KIT-28 twin of the selection bar).

## Accessibility

- Added and removed lines carry a `+` or `−` glyph and semantics ("Line 12 added: …", "Line 9 removed: …"), never only a tint (STATE-9).
- Moving to a change moves focus to its first line and announces "Change 2 of 7" once (the navigator label is a polite live region).
- The file header reads "README.md, 4 added, 1 removed, 1 of 3 files"; the picker row has button semantics and opens the file sheet.
- Line numbers are selectable 48 dp-tall targets when selection is on (the row is at least 48 dp tall only in selection mode; read-only rows keep the mono line height).
- 200 % text: lines wrap with hanging indents, the gutter grows with the numbers, and the header wraps to two lines.

## RTL

- The diff is always LTR: gutter on the left, old side on the left in split, text left-aligned (LAY-8, COPY-30).
- The header, navigator and selection bar follow the locale; the path is isolated with `KitBidi.ltr`; the previous/next arrows are up/down and do not mirror.

## Motion and haptics

- Gap bars unfold with `KitReveal` inside the virtualised list's item (the item rebuilds at its new height; no `AnimatedSize`, MOT-5).
- The navigator scrolls to a change on `KitMotion.standard` with `emphasized`, or jumps under `KitMotion.reduced(context)`.
- No layout animation while scrolling; rows are virtualised (`ListView.builder`/`SliverList`).
- Haptics: none (MOT-11: nothing on local choices or selection).

## Data safety and honest state

- **Read-only is the default.** Selection, Comment and Add to prompt appear only when the host passes a handler.
- **Redaction.** Copy lines, Copy file and Copy patch go through `KitCopy` and `KitRedact` (G12). The displayed diff is not masked (a change the agent made is shown as it is; SEC-2 covers logs, reports and the clipboard, and redacting a diff line would hide what is being reviewed). **Flag:** if the coordinator reads G12's "rendered text" as covering diffs, the builder adds display redaction; see Open questions.
- **Honest counts.** The header's counts come from `KitDiffFile.added`/`removed`, and a partial patch says "Showing 400 of 3,200 lines". A gap without its lines says it cannot expand.
- **Nothing is applied here.** Reverting a file or hunk is the host's act (DATA-11: confirm first), not a kit button.

## Depends on

- **From C25:** kit-KitChoiceList (tier 1c: `KitPickerRow`, `showKitChoiceSheet` for the file picker), kit-KitIconButton-v2 (tier 1a: navigator, Wrap, More, Clear), kit-KitAction-v2 (tier 1a: the selection bar's `KitActionBlock` with `disabledReason`).
- **Edges added** (README.md), both tier 1a, so the unit stays in tier 1d: kit-KitMenu (`fileActions` More menu and the right-click menu) and kit-KitPageRoute (`showKitDiff` and the wrapper's `DiffView.open`).
- **Existing kit parts:** `KitStateView` (inline empty and error; v1 API suffices), `KitSkeletonRows`, `KitReveal`, `KitButton`, `KitLayout`.
- **Pre-wave seams:** `KitTokens.hairlineWidth`, `KitBidi`, `KitCopy`, `KitRedact`.
- **Depended on by:** kit-KitRequestSheet and kit-KitToolRow (C25), and in waves 2–3 screen-review-1, shared-review-1, slice-P3.7a.

## Tests required

In `test/kit/kit_diff_view_test.dart` (and the wrapper's own `test/diff_view_test.dart`, unchanged):

1. Parser: `KitDiffFile.fromPatch` on a two-hunk patch gives the right added/removed counts, numbers and hunk lines; `fromTexts` folds unchanged runs into gaps with 3 context lines around each change; `fromTexts(after: …)` alone is status added.
2. Gaps: tapping a gap bar reveals 20 lines per tap and collapse hides them again; a patch gap (no lines) shows its count and no expand action.
3. Mode: `mode: null` renders unified in a 412 dp box and split in a 1280 dp box; `mode: split` in a 412 dp box renders unified; a KitDiffView in a 340 dp box on a 1600 dp window renders unified.
4. File list: 3 files in a 1600 dp box show the file list column; in 412 dp the picker row opens a sheet listing the 3 files with counts, and choosing one scrolls to it.
5. Navigator: with 2 files × 3 changes, "Change 1 of 6"; next five times reaches the second file's last change; `n`/`p` do the same with desktop capabilities; focus moves to the change and "Change 2 of 6" is announced once.
6. Not colour alone: an added line's semantics read "Line 12 added: …" and it shows a `+` glyph; a removed line "Line 9 removed: …" and `−`.
7. Selection (`readOnly: false`, `onComment` set): dragging line numbers 12–14 on the new side shows "3 lines selected" and the bar; Comment calls `onComment` once with `startLine: 12`, `endLine: 14`, side current and the redacted text; Esc clears. With `readOnly: true` no selection is possible.
8. Copy lines copies the selection through `KitCopy`, announces "Copied" once and shows no `SnackBar`; a fake `sk-ant-FAKE…` in the copied lines is redacted (G12).
9. States: `loading` shows skeleton lines; empty files show "No changes"; `error` with `onRetry` shows the error and Try again, which calls `onRetry` once; a binary file shows "Binary file · not shown"; a renamed file shows "Renamed from lib/old.dart".
10. Too big: `maxLines: 400` on a 3,200-line diff shows "Showing 400 of 3,200 lines" and "Open all" calls `onOpenAll`.
11. Wrap: a long line wraps with a hanging indent at 412 dp and scrolls sideways at 1280 dp; `onWrapChanged` receives the toggle.
12. Wrapper compatibility: `DiffView.single(FileDiff(...))` still shows `diff-file-header-<path>`, `diff-gap-0` and `diff-view-horizontal`, and its copy no longer shows a `SnackBar`.
13. RTL: under Arabic the lines are LTR and the old side is on the left in split.
14. Virtualisation: a 10,000-line file builds only visible rows.
15. Reduced motion (G8): gap expansion and change navigation settle after one `pump()`.
16. Overflow (G6): a 150-character path and a 400-character line at 320, 412, 600, 840 and 1280 dp × text 1.0/1.3/2.0 × LTR/RTL: no overflow.

## Galleries required

`test/goldens/kit/kit_diff_view_golden_test.dart`, DPR 3.0, Android, deterministic fixture files, names per TEST-20.

- **Each state at 412×915, dark and light:** `unified` (2 files, a gap, 3 changes), `selecting` (the selection bar), `binary_renamed` (both file kinds), `too_big`, `loading`, `empty`, `error`. 7 × 2 = 14 PNGs.
- **Default at 360×800, 915×412, 800×1280, 1280×800 and 1600×1000, dark and light:** 10 PNGs (unified up to 800, split at 1280, split with the file list at 1600).
- **Default at text 2.0 and in Arabic RTL, at 412×915 and 1280×800, dark and light:** 8 PNGs.
- **Total:** 32 PNGs.

## Non-goals

- No syntax colour inside diff lines (no KitCodeBlock edge; a later part may add it).
- No word-level (intra-line) highlighting in v2.
- No reverting, staging or applying changes; no inline review comments (the review workspace hands comments to the prompt).
- No mode control inside the part (the host's `KitSegmented` sets `mode`).
- No screen adoption; review_workspace, run results and request previews move in their own units.

## Open questions

1. **Does G12 ("never appear in rendered text") cover diff lines? (owner: a privacy decision)** This freeze redacts the diff's clipboard output but shows diff lines unmasked, because masking a changed line hides what the person is reviewing and could make them approve a change they cannot see. SEC-2 lists the clipboard but not the screen. If the owner or coordinator decides G12 covers diffs, display redaction is a one-line change in the line builder, and the gallery adds a masked-line case. Until they answer, the rule above applies.
