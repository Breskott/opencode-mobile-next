# KitStatusLine v2 — API freeze (wave 0)

Unit: `kit-KitStatusLine-v2` (wave 1, tier 1b, kind `kit-change`, model opus). Spec: kit-v2.md §2.3, §4.9, design standard §5, with cut review C25 (dependency: KitSince) and C26 (`since`/`onSlow` with a fake clock). Rules: KIT-35, STATE-5, STATE-14, STATE-19, ARCH-8, A11Y-3, LOOK-4, KIT-43.

## Purpose

One condition on an otherwise working screen: offline or reconnecting, Android stopped the app, heat, a risky switch that is on, an update ready, or the team's "Now" line. v2 adds:

- the 8 s escalation inside the kit;
- a `next` line (the team Now line);
- `KitStatus`, a status value one status source per entity produces, so words are mapped in one place;
- the priority order that `KitScreen`'s status slot uses to show exactly one line.

It replaces every `MaterialBanner` and the update and release snackbars.

## Replaces

- **Map elements, 30 on 26 pages (kit-v2.json assignment → `KitStatusLine`):**
  - `chat` (chat-auto-approval-indicator);
  - `demo` (demo-disclaimer);
  - `desktop-release-notice` (desktop-release-notice-snackbar);
  - `development-services` (unsupported-paragraph);
  - `embedded-auto-approval-indicator` (embedded-auto-approval-indicator-open);
  - `embedded-product-states` (embedded-product-states-refresh-retry);
  - `embedded-team-phone-section` (phone-status);
  - `embedded-termux-attention-line` (line);
  - `external-task` (external-task-status);
  - `files` (files-status-notice);
  - `model-picker-sheet` (model-footer);
  - `model-picker-sheet-options-dialog` (options-capabilities);
  - `phone-setup-customize-sheet` (totals);
  - `review-workspace` (review-workspace-refresh-banner);
  - `session-link-server-missing-banner` (…-banner, …-dismiss, …-open-servers);
  - `settings` (library-search-summary);
  - `share-session-failed-banner` (…-banner, …-retry);
  - `shorebird-update-notice` (…-got-it, …-receiving);
  - `team-agent` (team-agent-header);
  - `team-conversation` (team-conversation-now);
  - `team-home` (team-now-line);
  - `team-plugin-sheet` (team-sheet-status);
  - `terminal` (terminal-refresh-banner);
  - `terminal-surface` (terminal-surface-status);
  - `termux-processes` (summary);
  - `tools` (counters).
- **Banners and snackbars it replaces (G1 baseline):**
  - `MaterialBanner(`: `lib/main.dart` 2, `lib/ui/screens/run_result_screen.dart` 1, `lib/ui/screens/terminal_screen.dart` 1, `lib/ui/widgets/product_states.dart` 1;
  - the update and release snackbars: `lib/update/shorebird_update_notice.dart` SnackBar 2, `lib/update/desktop_release_check.dart` SnackBar 1.

  They are adopted by coord-main (C32), screen-system-2 (C31) and their screen units, not here.
- **Retires:** slice-P7.6's escalation for status lines (C41), and the hand-built Now lines in `team_now.dart` (adopted by shared-team-1).

## File

- `lib/ui/kit/kit_status_line.dart` (`KitStatusLine`, `KitStatus`, `KitStatusKind`)
- Tests: `test/kit/kit_status_line_test.dart`
- Gallery: `test/goldens/kit/kit_status_line_golden_test.dart`

**The slot.** `KitStatusScope`, `KitStatusLineSlot` and `KitStatusContribution` are frozen in `KitScreen.md` ("The status slot"), in a new file `lib/ui/kit/kit_status_slot.dart` that is in **this unit's write set** (README.md, decision D5; a build_units change). The reason is dependency order: kit-KitRowParts-v2 (tier 1d) adds its risky-switch condition through `KitStatusContribution`, and kit-KitScreen-v2 is in the same tier. This unit builds the file exactly as KitScreen.md freezes it; KitScreen-v2 only hosts the slot, and the one-per-window assert stays with KitScreen-v2.

## Public API

```dart
/// Which condition a status is, in priority order, highest first (KIT-35;
/// `work` placed below the shell conditions and above updates, see below).
enum KitStatusKind {
  connection,   // offline, reconnecting, not answering
  appStopped,   // Android stopped the app; background checks paused
  heat,         // the phone is hot; the team is paused

  work,         // a working screen's own line: the team Now line, a live process
  update,       // an app, code-push or server update is ready (STATE-19)
  info,         // anything else a screen shows (a search summary, a counter)
}

/// One condition, produced by the one status source for its entity (ARCH-8):

    required this.kind,
    required this.icon,
    required this.message,             // "Reconnecting to laptop…"
    this.id,                           // stable identity for dedupe and announcements: "connection:<profileId>"

    this.tone = AppStatusTone.neutral,

```

- **Why `work` sits between `riskySwitch` and `update`.** KIT-35 lists the shell's conditions (connection > Android stopped the app > heat > a risky switch > update ready) and says a pushed working screen's line "takes the shell's condition when that ranks higher". It does not say where the screen's own line ranks. Putting it above `update` keeps a team's Now line from being hidden by "Update ready", which STATE-19 calls the lowest condition. `info` is last.
- **`StatelessWidget` becomes `StatefulWidget`?** The escalation is `KitSince`'s rebuild, so the class may stay a `StatelessWidget` that wraps its content in `KitSince`. Either is API-compatible, because the public constructor is unchanged. The builder picks one.
- **`KitStatusLine.of`** maps every `KitStatus` field onto the constructor. The key defaults to `ValueKey('kit-status-${status.id ?? status.kind.name}')`.

## States

| State | What shows |
|---|---|
| condition | icon, message, optional `supporting`, optional `next`, action, More, dismiss (as today) |
| working (`tone: progress`) | the icon in `accent`; no spinner in the line (a spinner never runs silently past 8 s) |
| slow (escalated) | after 8 s since `since`: the supporting line reads KitSince's "Still waiting after 8 s"; the first `onSlow` action takes the action slot when it is empty, otherwise the `onSlow` actions go first in More; one announcement |
| Now line | `next` under the message in `text2`; it unfolds with `KitReveal` when it first appears and cross-fades when it changes |
| stacked (large text) | the action moves under the words (unchanged measuring); `controlsTogether` is unchanged |
| error | `tone: failure`: the neutral error glyph in `text1` (LOOK-5); the action is the fix ("Try again"); never a SnackBar |
| disabled | an action with `onPressed: null` shows its `disabledReason` under the line (kit-KitAction-v2); the line itself is never disabled |

Loading and empty do not apply: a status line exists only while its condition does. The host removes it through `KitReveal`.

**Tone and LOOK-4.** `AppStatusTone.attention` draws the warning glyph in `text1`, not amber: amber is reserved for needs-you (LOOK-4). A risky-switch line is `neutral` with the switch's glyph.

KIT-12 doc comment: "States: condition, working, slow, now-line, error (+ disabled action)".

## Tokens

- **ThemeRoles:**
  - icon per the shared tone map;
  - message `text1`;
  - supporting and next `text2`;
  - the bottom rule `hairline` at `KitTokens.hairlineWidth(context)` (pre-wave, LOOK-21), replacing `BorderSide(width: 0)`.
- **KitText:** `body` (message; today `bodyMedium`), `secondary` (supporting, next), `button` (via KitButton).
- **KitTokens:**
  - `smallIconSize` (20);
  - `space1`, `space2`, `space3` and `space4` (replacing `EdgeInsetsDirectional.fromSTEB(16, 2, 4, 2)`, `SizedBox(width: 12)`, `top: 15`, `vertical: 4/8`);
  - `minTarget` (More and dismiss);
  - `gutter`.
- **New tokens (pre-wave, `_new-tokens.md`):**
  - `KitTokens.statusLineMinHeight` = 52 (today the literal `minHeight: 52`);
  - the shared tone map `KitTokens.toneFor` / `toneColor` (README.md decision D12).

## Adaptive

- **compact:** full width directly under the top bar or header, on the 16 dp gutter.
- **medium:** the same, spanning the content area of its screen.
- **expanded / large:**
  - the shell's line spans the content area to the end of the rail;
  - in `KitScreen.twoPane`, a pushed working screen's line spans its own pane;
  - the action stays inline far more often, because the stacking is measured.

  "Also a count badge on the rail destination" (§8.2) is KitNeedsYou's, not this part's.
- **Short windows:** the same single line. `controlsTogether` keeps the controls visible.
- **Pointer and keyboard:**
  - Tab reaches the action, then More, then dismiss;
  - Enter and Space activate, and More opens its menu with Enter;
  - hover tooltips on More and dismiss repeat their labels (LAY-11);
  - it is not modal, so Esc does nothing.

## Accessibility

- One live region (unchanged). An announcement fires once per change of `(id, kind, message)`, and once on escalation. A change to `supporting` or `next` that only updates a time ("about 6 min" → "about 5 min") is not re-announced. The part compares its announcement key, not the full text.
- More and dismiss are 48 dp labelled controls (dismiss: `dismissTooltip`, or the existing `kitSheetDismiss` "Dismiss"; More: `kitMore`).
- At 200 % text, the message, supporting and next wrap and never truncate. The action stacks under them.
- A risky-switch line's action is the switch's "Turn off", so the switch can be turned off where it is shown (SEC-9).

## RTL

- The icon sits at the start, and More and dismiss at the end. Padding is directional (the existing `EdgeInsets.only(top: …)` becomes `EdgeInsetsDirectional`, G7).
- Server and conversation names inside `message`, `supporting` and `next` are wrapped by the status source with `KitBidi.auto` (COPY-30). Durations come from `intl`.

## Motion and haptics

- `KitEntrance` when the condition appears or its icon or tone changes (unchanged).
- `next` unfolds with `KitReveal` (`KitMotion.standard`).
- The escalation's supporting text cross-fades on `KitMotion.quick`.
- **Reduced motion:** instant.
- **Haptics:** none (MOT-11).

## Data safety and honest state

- **One status source per entity:** `KitStatusLine.of(status)` is the path for new code (ARCH-8). The existing string constructor stays for compatibility (KIT-43).
- **At most one line per window.** KitScreen-v2's slot enforces this with `KitStatus.highest`, plus a G37 debug assert in KitScreen. This part only provides the ordering.
- **No silent waits:** a `tone: progress` line with `since` escalates after 8 s (STATE-5). A progress line without `since` gets a doc warning only; a missing `since` cannot be asserted without false positives.
- **Honest dismiss:** dismiss is offered only when dismissing changes nothing real (DS §5, unchanged). A risky switch is never dismissible (assert: `kind == riskySwitch` with `onDismiss != null` fails), because hiding it would hide a live risk (SEC-9).
- **No contradictions:** the words never contradict the state (COPY-17). That is the status source's job, and G11 checks the fixtures.

## Depends on

- **kit-KitSince** (C25).
- **Existing:** `KitButton`, `KitAction`, `KitInset`, `KitEntrance`, `KitReveal`, `KitIconButton` (v1, for dismiss once the raw `IconButton` is replaced; optional).
- **Pre-wave:** `KitTokens.hairlineWidth`, `KitMotion.escalateAfter`.

Depended on by: KitScreen-v2 (the slot), KitRowParts-v2 (risky switch), screen-system-2, coord-main (C25, C31, C32).

## Tests required

In `test/kit/kit_status_line_test.dart`, using KitSince's fake clock:

1. `since` 7 s ago: unchanged. At 8 s: the supporting line reads "Still waiting after 8 s", the first `onSlow` action is visible in the action slot, and the rest are in More. Exactly one semantics announcement for the escalation.
2. `onSlow` with more than 2 actions throws an `AssertionError`.
3. `next` renders under the message. Changing only its numbers does not produce a new announcement.
4. `KitStatus.highest` over [update, connection, work] returns connection; over [update, work] returns work; ties keep the first; nulls are ignored.
5. `KitStatusLine.of(status)` renders the same text, actions and keys as the equivalent constructor call.
6. `kind: riskySwitch` with `onDismiss` asserts.
7. Existing constructor calls, including `controlsTogether`, `supporting` and `dismissKey`, keep their keys (`kit-status-more`, `kit-status-dismiss`) and their behaviour. The large-text stacking still works (existing behaviour, pinned).
8. `tone: attention` paints `text1`, not `attention` (LOOK-4). `failure` paints `text1` (LOOK-5).
9. Under reduced motion it settles after one `pump()` (G8).

## Galleries required

`test/goldens/kit/kit_status_line_golden_test.dart`, DPR 3, Android platform, under a stub top bar.

- **Declared states × dark and light at 412×915:**
  - connection (reconnecting, with action);
  - slow (escalated);
  - now-line (work, with next);
  - risky switch (with Turn off);
  - update ready;
  - error with Try again;
  - stacked at a long message.
- **Default (connection)** × dark and light at 360×800, 915×412, 800×1280, 1280×800 and 1600×1000.
- **Text 2.0 and Arabic** (connection, now-line) at 412×915 and 1280×800.
- **Names:** `kit_status_line_<state>…png`.

## Non-goals

- The one-per-window assert and hosting the slot inside `KitScreen` (kit-KitScreen-v2). The slot file itself is this unit's (see File).
- The status sources themselves (connection, heat, team). They are wave-2 or wave-3 work in their modules and use `KitStatus`.
- No replacement of any `MaterialBanner` or SnackBar call site in this unit.

## Open questions

- The ranking of `work` and `info`, where KIT-35 is silent, is decided above. KitScreen.md uses the same order. The coordinator may re-rank before wave 1 without changing the API, because only the enum order changes.
