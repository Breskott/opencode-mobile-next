# Termux → built-in Ubuntu backend — 2026-09-28

**Implemented backend; five-gap contract update below (2026-09-29).** The
[initial UI slice](../slice-migration-ui-2026-09-28/README.md) is merged; wiring
the new APIs remains with Claude. Feasible for managed Ubuntu projects
and confidential exports. A complete session/credential/AI Team runtime restore
is not established and is not offered. No owner-phone access, native changes,
UI edits, source deletion, or automatic sign-in occurred.

Finish line: inventory → bounded private transfer → verified staged import →
create/select built-in profile while retaining Termux. Non-goals: source cleanup,
restoring active sessions, activating imported commands, UI implementation.
Source base: `7954e980` on `codex/arm64` (merged phone-setup-v2).

## Feasibility and supported selection

The [detailed inventory](inventory.md) links the exact pinned upstream code.
Both managed hosts use OC1 **1.18.32** / OC2 **2.0.10**. Same pins are necessary
but insufficient to prove live SQLite/WAL portability; this transfer does not
execute source binaries to discover an actual installed version. Inventory
version fields are explicitly **unknown**, never substituted with pins. No
session import is enabled regardless of version. Termux OC2 may have default
or isolated XDG roots; built-in OC2 always uses `.oc-opencode2`. Both possible
source trees are preserved separately in the export, never merged or activated.

| Item | Implemented decision | Reason / destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Managed `/root/projects` repositories | Migrate, explicit selection | New `<filesDir>/projects/termux-<job>`; proot exposes `/root/projects/termux-<job>`. Never overwrite existing projects. |
| OpenCode config and MCP config | Offer private export | Includes `.config/opencode` and `.oc-opencode2/config`; paths, commands and embedded credentials require review before activation. |
| OpenCode data/sessions | Offer raw private export only | Both pins use SQLite/WAL; OC2 DB includes credentials. A live file copy is not a consistent backup or a supported cross-version import. Keep Termux for usable history; supported per-session CLI exports remain a manual option. |
| Provider auth (`auth.json`, OC2 credential table) | Require re-sign-in | Never activate copied credentials. They may be contained in a deliberately selected confidential data export; all exported files are 0600. |
| Global Git config | Offer private export | Helpers/paths/include files can be host-specific and values can contain secrets. Project `.git/config` remains part of its private repository. |
| Git credential stores / SSH private keys | Skip | Re-authenticate or separately provision keys. This backend does not implement the inventory's possible separate SSH-export offer. |
| Shell dotfiles | Optional private export | `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.profile`, `.zshrc`; never execute. Histories skipped. |
| AI Team state | Offer private export | Known managed Ubuntu/Termux state roots; no runtime activation or autonomous work resume. Toolchains are reinstalled through setup. |
| Caches/toolchains/manager secrets | Skip standalone migration | Source server identity/password/PID are not the destination server's identity. A selected project/export tree is copied as a unit; no claim of filtering every nested log/cache/secret. |

Only the managed `opencode-ubuntu` roots are supported, including old/new
proot-distro layouts. Arbitrary native-Termux installations need manual export.
Projects with links, devices/sockets, external `.git` worktree/submodule pointers,
unrepresentable USTAR names, or oversized trees are refused. Unsupported export
categories do not block supported projects: each inventory row has a typed
`problem`, whose zero size/count placeholders mean **unknown**, not empty.
Do not run migration during active project writes; tar detects some concurrent
changes but the project copy is not a transactional repository snapshot.
Local repository origins pointing outside the imported tree need review.

## Transfer, bounds, recovery and privacy

`RUN_COMMAND` executes fixed-source inventory and packing inside Termux. Archives
stay in `~/.oc/migration/<job>` with private modes. No shared-storage archive and
no binary payload through a bridge callback. The app binds `127.0.0.1:0`; a fresh
secure bearer authorizes 1 MiB PUT chunks. Payloads never enter logs, errors,
notifications, diagnostics, or preferences. Bridge callbacks contain only fixed
statuses, counts, bytes and hashes. HTTP content and bearer are never echoed.

Limits: **512 MiB archive / 20,000 entries per item**, strict uncompressed USTAR,
90-second source-command deadline (110-second bridge bound), 30-second curl bound,
40-second receive bound, and a **15-minute foreground attempt budget** checked at
phase/chunk boundaries. A current pack can take up to its own deadline to stop.
This is not a persistent foreground service and assumes no Android background
lifetime. UI must cancel on backgrounding; later Resume is explicit.

Preflight requires the built-in ready marker, reachable Termux, supported selected
items and known space on both filesystems. Before packing, reserve conservatively
`3 * Σ(logicalBytes + entries * 4096 + 10240) + 64 MiB` against **both** free-space
readings, because source archive, app archive and extracted files can share a
partition. Packing repeats its own space/size checks. No free-space reading is
an enduring reservation; later storage failures remain possible and typed.

A source job lock prevents overlapping pack retries. Immutable archive size/SHA
are journaled before copying. Chunk bytes are flushed before atomically advancing
the private offset sidecar; restart truncates uncommitted tail bytes and rotates
the bearer. Whole-archive SHA is checked before extraction. The importer rejects
traversal, links, hardlinks, special entries, duplicates and bad headers, writes
only private staging, verifies per-file hashes, then atomically renames the whole
item with its receipt. A crash after rename is recognized on resume. Modified
imported files cause `destinationConflict`, never overwrite.

Projects use 0700 directories, 0600 files (0700 for executable project files).
Non-project items remain inactive at:
`<filesDir>/linux/ubuntu/root/.oc-migration-exports/<job>/<item>`.
The hidden receipt includes file paths/hashes, never content, and is private.
Do not include these exports or receipts in automatic diagnostic attachments.
Completed app transfer caches are removed; committed projects/exports remain.
Termux originals and private transfer archives remain; source cleanup is a
separate explicit operation outside this job.

Journal: `oc.termuxMigration.<sourceProfileId>`; offer dismissal:
`oc.termuxMigrationOffer.<sourceProfileId>`. Existing profile deletion sweeps both.
Production checks `ConnectionController.isProfileReadable` before/after journal
writes and throughout work, preventing deletion races from recreating keys.
On next service creation, orphaned app transfer caches are removed; uncertain
journal ownership preserves caches. Imported projects/exports are retained app
files, not session state, and are not deleted merely by removing a server row.

## Exact UI hook-up contract (Claude owns UI)

Import only `package:opencode_mobile/domain/termux_migration_service.dart` for
this flow. It exports models/controller; UI must not invoke Termux scripts,
filesystem paths or profile mutations itself.

```dart
final migration = await TermuxMigrationService.create(
  connection: connection,
  builtinProfileName: l10n.phoneSetupProfileName, // existing localized key
);
// Keep one owner above routes. Render migration.snapshot via Listenable.
await migration.check(selected: {TermuxMigrationItem.projects});
await migration.start(
  sourceProfileId: termuxProfile.id,
  selected: {TermuxMigrationItem.projects}, // explicit reviewed selection
);
// After restart: savedSelection(id) gives prior selection; null means no job.
await migration.resume(termuxProfile.id);
// Cancel requests a stop; settlement is a separate observable event.
await migration.cancel();
await migration.whenSettled;
// Dispose only after cancellation/current operation settles.
migration.dispose();
```

`busy` stays true until
in-flight work and its stop command settle, even when snapshot phase already
reads `cancelled`. The final transition to `busy == false` notifies listeners.
No simultaneous second migration is admitted. Saved selection is immutable;
a different selection for that source returns `invalidSelection`. Completed
`start`/`resume` retries verify receipts locally without contacting Termux or
reconnecting. Use the read-only `completedJob(id)` query to render a historical
completion; that query does not reverify files users may have edited.
This v1 flow is a one-time migration, not ongoing two-way synchronization.

Entry points:

- **This phone, managed Termux user:** show “Move from Termux”; offer Resume if
  `savedSelection(profile.id)` exists. `TermuxMigrationService.eligible(profile)`
  determines eligibility. Show per-item size and migrate/export distinction.
- **One-time Termux server-row offer:** pure `shouldOffer(store, profile.id)`;
  call `dismissOffer` on dismissal. Do not run inventory merely because a row
  becomes visible. User opens the review flow first.
- **Setup v2:** `needsBuiltin` hands off to the existing built-in setup engine,
  host `SetupHostKind.builtin`; install Linux, essentials, Node and OpenCode of
  the source profile's runtime through the normal registry. Await setup finish,
  then `check()` and explicitly start/resume migration. Do not introduce a new
  installer or run setup and migration concurrently.

After import, the adapter reuses/creates the built-in profile with the source
flavor, starts it using the existing bounded health-check path, connects and
checks connection success. Only a verified imported **project location** follows;
workspace/session IDs do not. Source profile, pins, drafts, session models and
queued prompts remain unchanged. A failed switch retains imported files and both
profiles; it restores the prior Termux selection when this operation still owns
the selection. It does not override a simultaneous user server selection.
Rollback is selecting the retained Termux profile; no source restore is needed.

After successful connection, a separate explicit offer may call the existing
`ConnectionController.moveQueuedPrompts(sourceProfileID:, promptIDs:, sessionID:)`.
Use `sessionID: null` to create a new destination conversation, or an explicitly
chosen verified destination session. The existing API serializes queue writes,
rejects uncertain sends/source-local attachments, redacts moved content and
returns undo information. Never copy queue preference blobs or reuse source
session IDs. Do not auto-submit queued prompts as part of migration.

UI lifecycle: cancel when leaving foreground; keep listener ownership above the
sheet/page; disable duplicate start/resume and profile removal while busy; await
cancellation before navigation disposal. No raw exception, archive path or
bridge output belongs in a Details fold. Use kit components and normal localized
semantics/progress announcements. Only fixed codes and measured counts reach UI.

## Five-gap backend follow-up — 2026-09-29

Finish line: the existing transfer backend owns discard, durable completion,
review capacity, stop settlement and safe offline provider labels. Non-goal:
UI edits, device execution, source cleanup, credential activation or queue moves.
Base: `bcf45eb7` on `codex/arm64`, including the merged Claude UI slice. Existing
journal/receipt/transport contracts support all five changes; no new native or
source transfer protocol is needed. This closes gaps 1–5 in the UI slice's
“Contract gaps” section; its separate queued-prompt offer remains outside this job.

Import remains `domain/termux_migration_service.dart`; it also exports
`TermuxMigrationSpace`. Exact additions to `TermuxMigrationController`:

```dart
Future<TermuxMigrationDiscardResult> discardSavedCopy(String sourceProfileId);
Future<TermuxMigrationCompletedJob?> completedJob(String sourceProfileId);
Future<void> check({Set<TermuxMigrationItem> selected = const {}});
TermuxMigrationSpace reviewSpace(Set<TermuxMigrationItem> selected);
Future<void> get whenSettled;
Future<List<String>> providerNames(String sourceProfileId);
```

| API | Result and guarantees | Claude UI hook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `discardSavedCopy(id)` | `discarded`, `nothingSaved` (repeat-safe), or `alreadyCompleted` (preserved). Rejects active work with fixed `sourceBusy`; other failures use fixed `storage`. Removes app transfer cache first, then its scoped journal. Failure leaves metadata retryable. Never removes committed projects/exports, receipts, profiles or any Termux file. A later start gets a fresh job/folder. | Add “Start over” / “Discard saved copy” to failed or stopped copy. Stop and await settlement first. On success clear the owner's in-memory selection/request/source view, then check for a new selection, or leave the flow. |
| `completedJob(id)` | Null when absent/unfinished; otherwise immutable `TermuxMigrationCompletedJob(jobId: String, destinationProfileId: String)`. Reads validated schema/job/destination metadata only. Malformed completed metadata throws fixed `storage`. No phase mutation, Termux request, server selection, receipt revalidation or imported-file read. Remains true after user edits or destination-profile removal; it is history, not server health. | Replace `TermuxMigrationOwner.completedJob`'s separate preference read on This phone, server-row offer and page reopen. Read before considering Resume. Keep an async loading/unknown state; a read error is not “unfinished”. Cache only in memory if needed. |
| `check(selected: ...)` + `reviewSpace(selected)` | A successful `ready` snapshot includes `requiredBytes` for that selection and effective `availableBytes`. The default empty selection needs zero; it does not authorize start. `reviewSpace` recalculates locally using the last successful inventory/readings. Returns `requiredBytes`, `availableBytes`, `appAvailableBytes`, `sourceAvailableBytes` (all `int?`) and `sufficient` (`bool?`). Invalid/refused selection throws its fixed code; no successful inventory throws `invalidSelection`. Effective free is the smaller sandbox reading. Unknown app capacity stays null, and start fails closed. | Remove the screen's duplicate reserve formula. Initial review calls `check(selected: ...)`; checkbox changes use `reviewSpace`. Show needed and free with localized byte formatting. Refresh explicitly via check; start still performs a fresh preflight. After setup v2 returns, check again. |
| `whenSettled` + `busy` notification | Captures settlement of the currently admitted check/start/resume/discard, including the bounded stop command. Completes immediately when idle. Resume owns admission before its first journal read, so an immediate stop cannot miss it. `cancel()` still waits only for the stop command; cancelled phase can precede settlement. All terminal paths notify after setting busy false; future completes even after disposal. | Show “Stopping…” while cancelled and busy; enable Resume/Discard only after settlement. Keep the foreground owner until `await cancel(); await whenSettled;` and its own bookkeeping future finish. Do not dispose ownership or start another operation from the cancelled phase alone. |
| `providerNames(id)` | Sorted, unique **fixed labels** from an already imported, receipt-verified config export. Works offline and after restart, including a partial job whose config committed. Missing/unselected/changed/unsafe/unreadable config returns an empty list, meaning **unknown**, not no providers. No source command, auth-file/database read, credential activation or provider preference cache. | Replace the owner's persisted provider-name cache for the done/reopened view. Also usable for an existing exported copy during review. Before the first config export, offline names remain unknown; do not silently select/config-copy solely to populate the list. Keep generic sign-in copy when unknown. |

Offline discovery examines only four fixed JSON/JSONC files: `.config/opencode/`
`opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`, plus the corresponding files beneath
`.oc-opencode2/config/opencode/`. Reads are capped at 1 MiB per file, 64 provider
entries and 64 nesting levels. Root/descendant symlinks are rejected; trusted
platform aliases above the receipt-verified root are allowed. Recognized IDs
from top-level `provider`, `model` and `small_model` map to static labels;
custom IDs, arbitrary display names, model names, options and credential values
never leave the parser. No config is executed or activated. External includes
and unrecognized providers are intentionally not inferred.

**Copy correction for the UI:** `migrationSignInAgainNamed` currently says the
names “were signed in on Termux”. Exported configuration cannot prove that. Use
“{names} appear in your Termux settings. Sign in here to use them.” Authentication
remains unverified, including for known labels and local providers. Do not infer
that any particular free model will answer from this API.

Suggested UI copy additions (Claude owns localization/kit wiring):

| Key | Plain words |
| --- | --- |
| `migrationDiscard` | Discard saved copy |
| `migrationDiscardTitle` | Discard this saved copy? |
| `migrationDiscardBody` | Temporary copy files will be removed. Files already imported and everything in Termux will stay. |
| `migrationStartOver` | Start over |
| `migrationReviewSpace` | Needs about {needed} · {free} free |
| `migrationReviewSpaceUnknown` | Needs about {needed} · Free space unknown |
| `migrationStopping` | Stopping… |
| `migrationSignInConfigured` | {names} appear in your Termux settings. Sign in here to use them. |

Owner integration order for abandon/reselect:

```dart
await migration.cancel();
await migration.whenSettled;
// Await TermuxMigrationOwner's admitted future too, including its bookkeeping.
final result = await migration.discardSavedCopy(sourceId);
// alreadyCompleted: show completedJob(sourceId), never offer a destructive reset.
// discarded/nothingSaved: clear owner's cached request/selection; explicit review.
```

Do not issue discard directly from a button while the owner still has an admitted
operation. Hold the owner's operation guard through discard and its bookkeeping.
The backend also serializes mutations across controller instances. A cancelled
snapshot after discard has no job ID and no failure; it is not a resumable job.
`savedSelection(id) == null` is authoritative for that distinction.

The sole authoritative durable job key remains `oc.termuxMigration.<id>`; offer
dismissal remains `oc.termuxMigrationOffer.<id>`. No new keys/schema migration.
Claude should retire writes/reads of `oc.termuxMigrationDone.<id>` and
`oc.termuxMigrationProviders.<id>` in `lib/state/termux_migration_owner.dart`.
Those old scoped keys can be removed after switching to the backend queries;
do not manufacture a backend receipt from an old UI done flag. Existing deletion
sweeps cover both the backend and legacy keys. Discard preserves offer dismissal,
so abandoning a copy does not unexpectedly re-show a dismissed one-time offer.

UI touchpoints: `TermuxMigrationOwner` for forwarding APIs, ownership and retiring
its caches; `termux_migration_entry.dart` for async historical completion;
`termux_migration_screen.dart` for review capacity, discard, settling and names.
Setup v2 still uses its existing install-then-check path. No UI/owner/localization
file was edited by this backend follow-up.

Verification for this follow-up is recorded below separately from the original
backend's evidence. No owner phone, emulator, ADB, install, signing or push was
used. These APIs are implemented; the new UI actions/copy remain to be wired.

## States and copy keys to add

Names below are proposed English/Arabic ARB keys for Claude; no localization or
UI files were edited. Use localized byte formatting and `unknown` for refused
inventory rows, not their placeholder zero. No ETA or success inference from a
phase transition. `done` alone means import verification and profile connection
completed; it does not mean provider sign-in succeeded.

| Phase | Proposed key | Plain words |
| --- | --- | --- |
| checking | migrationChecking | Checking Termux and phone storage… |
| ready | migrationReview | Choose what to copy from Termux |
| needsSpace | migrationNeedsSpace | More free space is needed before copying. |
| needsBuiltin | migrationNeedsBuiltin | Set up the in-app server first. |
| termuxUnreachable | migrationTermuxUnavailable | Open Termux, then try again. |
| packing | migrationPacking | Preparing your files in Termux… |
| copying | migrationCopying | Copying files to this app… |
| unpacking | migrationUnpacking | Importing your files… |
| verifying | migrationVerifying | Checking the copied files… |
| switching | migrationSwitching | Connecting to the in-app server… |
| done | migrationDone | Files copied. Your Termux server is still available. |
| cancelled | migrationCancelled | Copy stopped. You can resume later. |
| failed | use code table | No raw error interpolation. |

| Failure code | Proposed key | Plain words |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unavailable | migrationTermuxUnavailable | Open Termux, then try again. |
| sourceChanged | migrationSourceChanged | Files changed during copying. Try again when Termux is idle. |
| sourceBusy | migrationSourceBusy | Termux is finishing the previous step. Try again shortly. |
| unsupportedEntry | migrationUnsupportedFiles | This item contains files that cannot be copied safely. |
| tooLarge | migrationTooLarge | This item exceeds the migration size or file limit. |
| invalidArchive / checksumMismatch | migrationVerificationFailed | The copy could not be verified. Your Termux files are unchanged. |
| destinationConflict | migrationDestinationChanged | Imported files changed. They will not be overwritten. |
| storage | migrationStorageFailed | The copy could not be saved. Check phone storage and try again. |
| timedOut | migrationTimedOut | This step took too long. Keep the app open and resume. |
| invalidSelection | migrationSelectionChanged | Use the saved migration selection to resume. |
| profileSwitch | migrationConnectionFailed | Files are copied, but the in-app server could not connect. |
| cancelled | migrationCancelled | Copy stopped. You can resume later. |

Additional copy: `migrationMoveFromTermux`, `migrationResume`, `migrationCancel`,
`migrationPrivateExport`, `migrationSessionsExportOnly`, `migrationSignInAgain`,
`migrationTermuxKept`, `migrationSizeUnknown`, and the six item labels.
Review must explain that config/MCP/shell/AI Team exports are inactive, session
exports may contain provider credentials and are not verified backups, sign-in
is required again, and Termux remains intact. Do not label this “move everything”.

## Follow-up verification — 2026-09-29

Backend/test commit: `3333f2ed`. Final affected backend tests plus all five
requested gates: **132 passed, 19 seconds** (40 migration checks and 92 gate
checks). Earlier in this follow-up, the merged UI regression also passed:
**29 tests**, within a 68-test focused run. The subsequent provider-path alias
fix was covered by the final provider/archive rerun; UI files stayed unchanged.
Whole-project `flutter analyze --no-pub`: **no issues, 14.7 seconds** after fixing
three brace-style findings from the initial analyzer run. No ignores or baselines
were added/changed. All heavy commands used the shared machine lock.

Pinned toolchain and final commands:

```bash
migration_flutter=/home/eslam/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter/91f8bd75076e9c740aa13cf67eb9ec1a093f68f5/bin/flutter

  test/no_raw_error_text_test.dart test/architecture_boundaries_test.dart \
  --reporter expanded

tool/qa/machine_lock.sh analyze -- "$migration_flutter" analyze --no-pub
```

Formatting: pinned `dart format --language-version=3.10 --output=none
--set-exit-if-changed` on all 11 changed Dart files: **0 changes**. `git diff
--check` and README local-link checks passed. Behavior coverage includes failed
packing → discard → restart, cleanup failure retaining the journal, preserved
committed files/completed records, offline completion after restart and edited
projects, identical review/start budgets and unknown space, delayed copy plus
stop-command settlement, immediate cancellation during resume's first journal
read, scoped journal deletion, verified offline config names, malformed/large
JSONC, fixed-label redaction and symlink/alias boundaries. No full repository
suite or device proof is claimed; the emulator recipe below remains unexecuted.

## Original verification and emulator replay

Backend/test commit: `aeb3ef67`. Final shared-lock test command covered all four
migration files plus `kit_ratchet`, `redaction`, `ui_glossary`,
`no_raw_error_text`, and `architecture_boundaries`: **127 passed, 16 seconds**.
The affected transport file was repeated after its final source-root/mode
adjustment: **11 passed**, including real Bash/tar/curl fixture execution.
Whole-project `flutter analyze --no-pub`: **no issues, 8.9 seconds**. Pinned
Shorebird Flutter 3.47.1, Dart formatting, whitespace and documentation-link
checks passed. [Verification and source hashes](verification.json). No full product suite
or real-device migration is claimed. Emulator proof was deferred to preserve the
requested budget; host tests exercise the real generated Bash/tar/curl stream as
well as fake bridge/filesystem failure paths.

For a later emulator-only proof: follow
[the boot recipe](../emulator-boot-2026-09-27/README.md); every adb invocation must
select `-s emulator-5554`. Use a separate preview app and synthetic Termux managed
Ubuntu fixture, including a repository, config with a fake credential, and a
SQLite/WAL fixture. Configure the normal RUN_COMMAND permission. Review sizes,
run projects+exports, interrupt during copy, relaunch/resume, verify checksums and
0600/0700 modes, confirm the fake credential never reaches logcat/diagnostics,
then verify built-in connection and the retained Termux profile. Test cancellation
and a corrupt archive without deleting source data. Remove only created preview
fixtures and shut down the owned emulator. Never substitute the owner's phone.
