/// available on this server · Why". Rows a server cannot serve stay off the
/// panel; this line is the one place that says so, instead of dimmed rows.
///
/// It sits on the group's label rail (the gutter plus the label inset), so
/// it reads as part of the group above it. The [action] is a tertiary
/// button at the end of the line; when the words and the action do not fit
/// on one line (long words, large text) the action wraps under the words,
/// start-aligned.

/// States: none — a passive line; its one action has no state of its own.
