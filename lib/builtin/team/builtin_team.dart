/// class does the rest, per project and on request, never as part of the
/// first setup (a team needs a project, which only exists after it):
/// - [turnOn] makes the team's store once, adds the project to it (with a
///   git `origin` on the phone when it has none, where the agents push their
///   work), starts the supervisor and waits until it answers;
/// - [start] / [stop] run the supervisor as the app's second long-running
///   service ([BuiltinLinux.startService]), beside the OpenCode server, so
///   it lives as long as the app does and not as long as some script;
/// - [config] is the AI Team plugin config the in-app profile gets, which
///   is what makes the Team card, the Inbox gates and the plugin screens
///   show this team.
